## Sample Use Case Implementation

### Making a Bill Payment

Use the CheckFree Next APIs to enable a custom UI to accept bill payments for one or more businesses and submit the payments for processing to the Fiserv payment services. Follow this recommended sequence for the best results:

1.  [Authenticate](?path=docs/resourcesAndGuides/authenticate.md): Authenticate to get the access token and the refresh token.

2.  [Get User Info](?path=docs/apiDomains/users.md&branch=develop#get-user-information): Get the details of the consumer including the contact information.

3.  [Get Payees](?path=docs/apiDomains/payees.md&branch=develop#get-payees-list): Get a list of businesses that the consumer has added as payees.

4.  [Get Bank Accounts](?path=docs/apiDomains/bankAccounts.md&branch=develop#get-bank-accounts-for-a-consumer-list): Get a list of accounts available for a consumer to fund a bill payment.

5.  [Get Transaction Calendar](?path=docs/apiDomains/transactionCalendar.md&branch=develop#get-transaction-calendar): Get a list of all available dates to deliver a payment to the selected payee along with associated fees

6.  [Create a Transaction](?path=docs/apiDomains/transactions.md&branch=develop#create-a-transaction): Schedule one or more payments from the consumer to the selected payee

### Find Bills Through Bill Discovery

CheckFree Next enables your end users to find their bills automatically using the information from their credit report and/ or biller direct statements and pay them conveniently without having to start from a blank slate. After consumer eligibility has been confirmed, the UI must record an explicit consent from the consumer in order to pull data from credit bureaus and/or biller direct sources. After the consumer gives consent, the API will return all found bills as a list. The UI should display all results to the consumer and enable the consumer to select one or more of the potential payees from the list to add as payees to the bill pay. Payees added via bill discovery also may deliver bill summaries to the consumer without the consumer having to sign up for e‑bills.

1.  [Authenticate](?path=docs/resourcesAndGuides/authenticate.md) – Authenticate to get the access token and the refresh token.

2.  [Get Consumer Eligibility for Bill Discovery](?path=docs/apiDomains/potentialPayees.md&branch=develop#get-consumer-eligibility-for-bill-discovery) – If the sponsor is configured with eligibility rules, determine if the consumer is eligible for bill discovery and if there are outstanding potential payees.

3.  [Record User Consent](?path=docs/apiDomains/users.md&branch=develop#record-users-consent-information) – If the consumer is eligible for bill discovery, capture the consent from the consumer for finding bills from bureau and billers.

4.  [Find Bills](?path=docs/apiDomains/potentialPayees.md&branch=develop#get-potential-payees-list) – Use the GET Potential Payees API to get the suggested billers for the consumer once the consumer has given the consent and has at least one outstanding potential payee. This will not return any results if the consent was either not provided by the consumer or the UI has not sent the same to the API. Display all potential payees to the consumer to select one or more for adding as payees.

5.  [Verify Potential Payee](?path=docs/apiDomains/potentialPayees.md&branch=develop#verify-potential-payee) – Once the consumer has selected one or more potential payees to add, use this API to add the billers as Payees and make them available to make a payment.
